This release contains bug fixes and new features.

How to Install Orchard
----------------------

To install Orchard using WebPI, follow these instructions:
<https://docs.orchardproject.net/Documentation/Installing-Orchard>.
Web PI will detect your hardware environment and install the application.

Alternatively, to install the release manually, look for the release files on 
https://github.com/OrchardCMS/Orchard/releases

<https://docs.orchardproject.net/Documentation/Manually-installing-Orchard-zip-file>

The zip contents are pre-built and ready-to-run. Simply extract the contents of the Orchard
folder from the zip contents to an IIS virtual directory (or site root) and then point your
browser to the site. You can also just extract to a local folder and open the Orchard
folder in Visual Studio or WebMatrix as a web site (but not as a web application).
Please make sure you have a machine key
<https://docs.orchardproject.net/Documentation/Setting-up-a-machine-key>
or you may experience frequent disconnections.

What file to download?
----------------------

You will find the files to download on our Github release page: https://github.com/OrchardCMS/Orchard/releases/tag/1.10.3

If you just want to use Orchard and don't care about the source code, Orchard.Web.1.10.3.zip
is what you want to use, preferably through the WebPI instructions.
Do not attempt to build the WebPI version in VS. Use the full source if you want to use VS.

If you want to take a look at the source code or want to be able to build the application in Visual Studio,
https://github.com/OrchardCMS/Orchard/archive/1.10.3.zip is fine.

If you want to setup a development environment for patch or module development,
you should clone the repository by following the instructions here:
<https://docs.orchardproject.net/Documentation/Setting-up-a-source-enlistment>

Branches are described here: <https://docs.orchardproject.net/Documentation/Developer-FAQ#Whatarethedefaultanddevbranches?WhichoneshouldIbeusing?>
